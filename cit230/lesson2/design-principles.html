            <h2>CONTRAST</h2>
            <h3>Dodge</h3>
            <a href="https://www.dodge.com/">Dodge Site Link</a>
            <img src="/lesson2/images/dodge.jpg">
            <p>I love dodge cars and since I mostly check their website, I decided to use it for this assignment. 
                I like how the contrast on their site. 
                I noticed the animations with the text and how their images are well organized(not forgetting the contrast in their design.)
                 Hence their color scheme "red & black" is awesome and makes everything catchy likewise the contrast very nice.</p>

            <h2>White Space and<br/> Clean Design</h2>
            <h3>RAMAFRIQUE</h3>
            <a href="http://www.ramafrique.com/">Ramfrique website link</a>
            <img src="/lesson2/images/ramafrique.jpg">
            <p>This is a good friend of mine's website and I feel the website has a very good layout but the banner picture doesn't show fully when on mobile view. 
                The clearity, fonts, and images are well alligned and readable which I would say has a good User Experience</p>

            <h2>ALIGNMENT</h2>
            <h3>BYU-IDAHO</h3>
            <a href="http://www.byui.edu/">Brigham Young University, idaho Link</a>
            <img src="/lesson2/images/byui.jpg">
            <p>BYUI has thousands of users or customers who access their site or use the sites for various needs or means.
                 Alignment plays an intergral role in making it's website look organized for both the young and old in terms of targeted audience. 
                 All the text, images, logos, video frames are well laid out or alligned and organized whether if they're on mobile view or desktop view.
